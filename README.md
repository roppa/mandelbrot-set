# Mandlebrot Set

## Definitions

- set: a collection of things which are not ordered and have no duplicates
- real number: used for counting, just what you use daily
- imaginary number: imagine (see we started already) squaring a negative number. Doesn't really make sense unless the universe became inverted, but there we go using imagination again. -2 squared would be 4, which is positive - because 2 negatives is a positive. So it doesn't make logical sense, but that number exists, so we call it imaginary
- complex number: a real number combined with an imaginary number. It gets complex
